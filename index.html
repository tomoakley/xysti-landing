          <p>Xysti has been created by Tom Oakley for his Final Year Project at Brunel University. While it will hopefully be a real product in the coming months, currently it is simply a prototype. No real booking happens and the sessions/facilities are fake. I really need user feedback to help me complete my dissertation. Any feedback will be gratefully received at tom@tomoakley.me. Thanks!</p>
          <strong class="display--block">What's with the name?</strong>
          <p>Xysti was an architectural term used in Ancient Greece for the covered portico of a gymnasium, where exercises took place in the winter and bad weather. I wanted a name that was obscure enough that it caught people's attention, but still had something to do with sports and physical activity, and that didn't sound techy. Also, the domain name was available!</p>
